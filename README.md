# GenshinArtifactHelper
A python script to automatically asses Genshin Impact artifacts to see which ones are worth keeping. (Work in progress)


Takes input in the form of a JSON file formatted using the Genshin Open Object Description (GOOD) format. More info about the format can be found here:
https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/doc/

Evaluates each artifact in the file based on set and stats and gives it a score for each character. The scores are based on the information in this document (Community Character Builder by the Genshin Helper Team):

Requires Python 3.10 or later to run.


The script is a complete mess, but this is mostly a learning exercise for me to learn Python, JSON and programming in general.
